# Cancer-Code
Website providing cancer support

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Unavailability of additional support and monitoring, which is necessary for cancer patients and their families.

DESCRIPTION

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It develops into a life-threatening situation mainly due to insufficient 
knowledge and negligence among people. Also, consultations for minor health concerns can be avoided, allowing doctors to spend more 
time with patients who need their attention the most. Thus, there is a dire need for a service which can provide accurate and timely 
solutions that can be accessed anytime, anywhere and by anyone.

SOLUTION

This service is provided by Cancer Code. On our website you can find a chatbot that answers all the possible questions that you might 
have regarding cancer. The site also has information about specialists to save you time from browsing and finding the right doctor for you. 
Another great feature that our website has is that it gives opportunity to the patients to contribute for further research and development 
into the field of cancer by filling a form about the details of their personal experiences with the disease.
